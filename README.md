## My Reflection  
During the activity assemble pc, the first step in PC assembly involves selecting components such as the motherboard, CPU, GPU, RAM, storage and power supply. Compatibility between components is crucial, requiring careful consideration to ensure optimal performance. This phase emphasizes the importance of research and planning. Understanding the compatibility of components ensures a smooth assembly process and prevents issues that may arise during or after assembly. PC assembly is hands-on experience that provides valuable learning opportunities. Connecting cables, installing components, and troubleshooting issues offer practical insights into the inner workings of computer. Engaging in the physical assembly of a PC fosters a sense of acccomplishment and builds technical skills.  
## Feedback/Suggestion
My feedback is PC assemble is very important thing for computer science students because this is their course. It becomes something that every student must know. But the PC used is an old PC and does not follow today's specs. Old PC's also have sharp parts if touched wrongly and also it complicated compared to today's PC. Therefore, I propose to change the PC to the lates version. At the very least, today's PC are easy to install, accessible and more secure.
